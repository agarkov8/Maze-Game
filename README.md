# Maze-Game

University Team Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A randomly generated maze with 4 target cells at each corner is generated. A Dijkstra algorithm calculates the shortest path to the target cell and if the player leaves the shortest path, the color of the figure turns red and the player cannot complete the game.

If the player does not leave the shortest path and has successfully completed the maze game and it depends on the corner, another game can be started using the ENTER button or the specialized button in the menu.

Game 1 is based on the Knapsack Problem, Game 2 presents the Graph Coloring Problem, Game 3 presents the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem, and Game 4 presents the Center Selection Problem.
